# iHaveIt

## Description 
`iHaveIt` is my project for the WTMB JavaScript Crash Course! :) 

Have you ever bought or gotten something that you already had? Perhaps more than once? 
Yes! I have too! For this reason, iHaveIt was created! 

iHaveIt :heavy_check_mark: helps us track items like groceries, books, movies, etc. that we are not sure if we have
already and that we may end up buying or getting again (sometimes multiple times!).

## Tech Stack 
* Node v8.7.0
* Express 4.16.2

### Front-end
The Front-end side of the application was developed in a separate repository, [here](https://github.com/mignonnesaurus/i-have-it-web) and you can see it running [here](https://mignonnesaurus.github.io/i-have-it-web/).
